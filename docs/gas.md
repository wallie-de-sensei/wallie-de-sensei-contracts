# Gas Profiling and Budget Review

This document describes the gas (CPU and Memory) costs for the Fluxora streaming contract.

## WASM Size Budgets

Every CI build compiles all three contracts to `wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and asserts
that the resulting artifact stays within its byte budget. A contract that exceeds its budget
fails the `wasm-size-budget` CI job.

Budgets were set with **~25% headroom** above the sizes measured during the June 2026 baseline
audit. Soroban's practical upload ceiling is ~100 KiB after Brotli compression; raw WASM budgets
are intentionally more conservative to leave room for future features and keep upload fees low.

| Contract | Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fluxora_stream` | 256 KiB (262 144 bytes) | Largest contract; full streaming surface area |
| `fluxora_factory` | 128 KiB (131 072 bytes) | Policy wrapper; should stay small |
| `fluxora_governance` | 128 KiB (131 072 bytes) | Minimal timelock; should stay small |

### Enforcement

The `script/check-wasm-size.sh` script implements the check:

```bash
# Check raw release artifacts (run locally after a WASM build):
bash script/check-wasm-size.sh

# Check optimized artifacts (after running stellar contract optimize):
bash script/check-wasm-size.sh --optimized
```

The `wasm-size-budget` CI job:
1. Builds all three contracts with `cargo build --release --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. Runs `stellar contract optimize` on each artifact (best-effort; failures are non-fatal).
3. Calls `script/check-wasm-size.sh` — **fails the job** if any artifact exceeds its budget.

### Updating a Budget

If a deliberate, reviewed feature addition requires more space:

1. Land the feature and measure the new raw size locally.
2. Add ~25% headroom to the measured size, rounding up to the nearest 64 KiB boundary.
3. Update the budget constant in `script/check-wasm-size.sh`.
4. Update the table above with the new value and a note explaining the change.
5. Include the change in the PR description.

### Optimize step

`stellar contract optimize` runs `wasm-opt -Oz` on the artifact, typically reducing binary
size by 10–30%. CI runs this step and checks the resulting `.optimized.wasm` file as an
informational pass. The hard budget gate runs against the **raw** release artifact so that the
check remains reproducible without the Stellar CLI installed.

## Safe Batch Limits

| Operation | Batch Size | Recommended CPU Budget |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| `create_streams` | 1 | 1.5M |
| `create_streams` | 10 | 10M |
| `create_streams` | 50 | 40M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 1 | 1.0M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 10 | 6M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 50 | 20M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 100 | 35M |

## Hot Path Analysis

### `withdraw`
The `withdraw` function is the most common operation. Its cost is dominated by:
1. Loading the `Stream` state.
2. Accrual calculation.
3. Token transfer (external call).
4. Saving updated `withdrawn_amount`.

### `batch_withdraw`
To reduce gas, `batch_withdraw` optimizes by:
1. Caching the ledger timestamp.
2. Performing a single authorization check.
3. Processing multiple streams in a loop.

## Performance Metrics

The following table provides the CPU instruction counts for core operations.

<!-- GAS_BASELINE_START -->
{
  "create_stream": 0,
  "withdraw": 0,
  "batch_withdraw": {
    "1": 0,
    "10": 0,
    "50": 0,
    "100": 0
  }
}
<!-- GAS_BASELINE_END -->

*Note: Baselines are currently initialized to 0 and should be updated after the first successful run of `script/validate_gas.py` once the contract compiles.*

## Governance Operations

The governance contract (`fluxora_governance`) handles proposal creation, approval, and execution with bounded costs to prevent DoS attacks.

### Budget Thresholds

These thresholds are enforced by the gas regression tests in `contracts/governance/tests/gas_regression.rs`. CI will fail if any operation exceeds its budget.

#### Propose

Creating a new proposal stores the calldata and proposal metadata. Cost is independent of signer count since we don't iterate over signers during creation.

| Metric | Threshold | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| CPU Instructions | ≤ 1,000,000 | Independent of calldata size |
| Memory Bytes | ≤ 100,000 | Independent of calldata size |

The calldata is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes) to keep storage costs reasonable.

#### Approve

Approving a proposal involves checking the signer's membership (O(1) via Map index) and appending to the approvals list. The cost scales linearly with the number of existing approvals since we store them as a Vec.

| Signer Count | CPU Threshold | Memory Threshold |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1-5          | ≤ 375,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 37,500 + 7,500 per signer |
| 6-10         | ≤ 750,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 75,000 + 7,500 per signer |
| 11-20        | ≤ 1,125,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 112,500 + 7,500 per signer |
| Max (20)     | ≤ 1,500,000 | ≤ 150,000 |

**Why it matters**: The approvals list is capped at `MAX_SIGNERS` (20), so the maximum cost is bounded. The O(1) duplicate check via the approval index Map prevents additional scanning overhead.

#### Execute

Executing a proposal processes the stored calldata. The cost scales with calldata size since we need to read and process the payload.

| Calldata Size | CPU Threshold | Memory Threshold |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 0-1 KB        | ≤ 5,000,000 | ≤ 500,000 |
| 1-2 KB        | ≤ 6,250,000 | ≤ 625,000 |
| 2-3 KB        | ≤ 7,500,000 | ≤ 750,000 |
| 3-4 KB        | ≤ 8,750,000 | ≤ 875,000 |
| Max (4 KB)    | ≤ 10,000,000 | ≤ 1,000,000 |

**Why it matters**: Calldata is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes), so even the worst-case execute cost is bounded. This prevents malicious proposals from being too expensive to execute.

### Worst-Case Scenario

The most expensive governance operation is executing a proposal with:
- `MAX_SIGNERS` (20) approvals
- `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes) calldata

| Operation | CPU | Memory |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Propose | ≤ 1,000,000 | ≤ 100,000 |
| Approve (all 20) | ≤ 1,500,000 | ≤ 150,000 |
| Execute | ≤ 10,000,000 | ≤ 1,000,000 |

All operations fit comfortably within Soroban's default budget limits.

### Denial of Service Protection

The governance contract is protected against DoS attacks through:

1. **Bounded approvals**: The signer set is capped at `MAX_SIGNERS` (20), making the approval scan O(n) where n ≤ 20.

2. **Bounded calldata**: The calldata payload is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes), limiting storage and processing costs.

3. **O(1) lookups**: Signer membership and duplicate approval checks use Map indices, avoiding linear scans of the signer list.

4. **Proposal expiry**: Proposals expire after `MAX_PROPOSAL_AGE_SECONDS` (30 days), preventing accumulation of stale proposals.

### Regression Testing

The gas regression tests run on every PR and CI build:

```bash
cargo test --test gas_regression -- --nocapture
