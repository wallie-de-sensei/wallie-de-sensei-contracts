## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Rust installed** (v1.70+)  
  ```bash
  rustup --version
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

- [ ] **Stellar CLI installed** ([install guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup))  
  ```bash
  stellar --version
  ```

- [ ] **Testnet account with funds**  
  - Create/fund via [Stellar testnet faucet](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)
  - Funded account = **Deployer account** (holds the contract, cov gas fees)

- [ ] **Environment variables configured**  
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  # Then edit .env with:
  export STELLAR_SECRET_KEY="S..."           # Deployer secret key
  export STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS="G..."        # Admin/treasury public key
  export STELLAR_TOKEN_ADDRESS="C..."        # USDC or test token contract address
  export STELLAR_NETWORK="testnet"           # (optional)
  export STELLAR_RPC_URL="https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org"  # (optional)
  ```

---

## Build & Deploy

### 1. Build the contract

```bash
cargo build --release -p wallie_de_sensei_stream --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Expected output: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wallie_de_sensei_stream.wasm` (~150 KB)

### 2. Upload & deploy via script (recommended)

The deployment script handles WASM upload, contract deployment, and init in one go:

```bash
source .env
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates env vars and CLI prerequisites
- ✅ Builds the WASM binary
- ✅ Uploads WASM to testnet (idempotent — skips if unchanged)
- ✅ Deploys contract instance (idempotent — skips if already deployed)
- ✅ Invokes `init` to set token and admin
- ✅ Saves contract ID to `.contract_id` for future use

**Output:** Contract ID will be saved to `.contract_id` file (example: `CAHUB4AGDYVQ3G5T3B...`)

### 3. (Alternative) Manual deployment steps

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# Step 1: Upload WASM
WASM_ID=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wallie_de_sensei_stream.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org)

# Step 2: Deploy contract
CONTRACT_ID=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash "$WASM_ID" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org)

# Save for later
echo "$CONTRACT_ID" > .contract_id
```

---

## Initialize Contract

The contract requires `init` to be called exactly once, setting the token address and admin.

### Via deployment script (automatic)

The script calls `init` automatically at the end:

```bash
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh
```

### Manual init invocation

If you deployed manually or need to re-initialize:

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=$(cat .contract_id)  # or use your deployed contract ID

stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -- init \
    --token "$STELLAR_TOKEN_ADDRESS" \
    --admin "$STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS"
```

**Note:** `init` can only be called once. Calling it again will fail (by design).

---

## Verification

After deployment, verify the contract is working:

### 1. Read configuration

Check that `init` succeeded by reading the contract config:

```bash
CONTRACT_ID=$(cat .contract_id)

stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -- get_config
```

Expected output: `{"token": "C...", "admin": "G..."}`

### 2. Create a test stream

Create a sample stream to verify `create_stream` works:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -- create_stream \
    --sender "$STELLAR_ADMIN_ADDRESS" \
    --recipient "GBRPYHIL2CI3WHZDTOOQFC6EB4CGQOFSNQB37HY5SKBRZGTAE3Z5MJGF" \
    --deposit_amount 1000000 \
    --rate_per_second 1000 \
    --cliff_time 1700000000 \
    --end_time 1800000000
```

Expected output: Stream ID (e.g., `0`) printed to console

### 3. Query stream state

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -- get_stream_state \
    --stream_id 0
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "sender": "G...",
  "recipient": "G...",
  "deposit_amount": 1000000,
  "rate_per_second": 1000,
  "start_time": ...,
  "cliff_time": ...,
  "end_time": ...,
  "withdrawn_amount": 0,
  "status": "Active"
}
```

## Network Details

### Stellar Testnet RPC

- **RPC URL:** `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`
- **Network Passphrase:** `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`
- **Network ID:** `testnet`

The deployment script uses the RPC URL and network name automatically. No manual configuration needed unless you override with `STELLAR_RPC_URL`.

### Viewing contracts on Explorer

After deployment, you can view your contract on the **Stellar testnet explorer**:

- [Stellar Expert Testnet](https://testnet.stellar.expert/)
- Search for your **Contract ID** (from `.contract_id`)

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY not set`

**Problem:** Deployment script exits with env var error.

**Solution:**
```bash
export STELLAR_SECRET_KEY="S..."  # or source .env
```

### ❌ `stellar CLI not found`

**Problem:** CLI is not installed or not in PATH.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Stellar CLI
# https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup

# Verify installation
stellar --version
```

### ❌ `Contract deploy failed — no contract ID returned`

**Problem:** Contract deployment failed, usually due to insufficient funds or RPC timeout.

**Solution:**
- Verify your deployer account has funds:
  ```bash
  stellar account info --network testnet --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY"
  ```
- Re-run the deployment script (idempotency should retry the deploy)
- Check RPC status: `curl https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/health`

### ❌ `init may have already been called`

**Problem:** `init` fails because it's already been called.

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior. `init` can only run once.
- Verify with `get_config`. If it returns token and admin, `init` succeeded.

### ❌ `WASM binary unchanged` but deploy failed

**Problem:** Script skips WASM re-upload but you want to force a fresh upload.

**Solution:**
```bash
rm .wasm_id .wasm_id.sha256 .contract_id
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh
```

This forces a fresh WASM upload and new contract deployment.

### ❌ `RPC timeout or slow` responses

**Problem:** Testnet RPC is slow or unresponsive.

**Solution:**
- Check RPC status: https://status.stellar.org/
- Temporarily use alternative RPC (if available)
- Retry the deployment after a few minutes

## Version Migration

### V5 → V6 Migration Playbook

This section describes what changed between `CONTRACT_VERSION = 5` and `CONTRACT_VERSION = 6`, which DataKey entries were added or removed, the required admin migration steps, and the rollback procedure.

> **Cross-reference:** See [storage.md](./storage.md#version-history) for the full DataKey discriminant table and evolution policy.

---

#### What changed in V6

| Category | Change | Breaking? |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| New entrypoint | `delegated_withdraw` — relayer-submitted withdrawal with ed25519 signature committing to `(stream_id, nonce, deadline, expected_minimum_amount)` | Additive |
| New entrypoint | `get_delegated_nonce` — view: current replay-protection nonce for a recipient | Additive |
| New entrypoint | `set_auto_claim` — recipient registers a permissionless auto-claim destination; now validates against zero address | Additive |
| New entrypoint | `revoke_auto_claim`, `trigger_auto_claim`, `get_auto_claim_destination` | Additive |
| New constant | `MAX_PAUSE_REASON_BYTES = 256` — pause-reason strings are now bounded | Behaviour change: previously unbounded reasons now rejected if > 256 bytes |
| New error codes | `InvalidSignature = 15`, `BelowMinimumAmount = 16`, `InvalidAutoClaimDestination = 17`, `PauseReasonTooLong = 18` | Additive |
| New DataKey | `DelegatedWithdrawNonce(Address)` — discriminant 10, persistent | Additive |
| Perf | `batch_withdraw` / `batch_withdraw_to` cache `env.ledger().timestamp()` before the loop | No observable change |

#### New DataKey entries (V6)

| Discriminant | Variant | Storage type | Value type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `DelegatedWithdrawNonce(Address)` | Persistent | `u64` | Per-recipient nonce; absent until first `delegated_withdraw` call; starts at 0 |

No existing DataKey entries were removed or reordered. All V5 persistent entries remain readable on a V6 instance.

---

#### Required admin migration calls

Because V6 adds only new entrypoints and a new DataKey (append-only), **no on-chain state transformation is required**. The migration procedure is:

1. **Deploy the V6 contract instance** (new `CONTRACT_ID`).
2. **Call `init`** on the new instance with the same `token` and `admin` as V5.
3. **Verify version**: `stellar contract invoke --id <NEW_ID> -- version` must return `6`.
4. **Verify config**: `stellar contract invoke --id <NEW_ID> -- get_config` must match V5 config.
5. **Announce migration** to all integrators, wallets, and indexers with the new `CONTRACT_ID`.
6. **Allow in-flight streams to drain** on the V5 instance before abandoning it (see below).

There is no `migration_v5_to_v6` on-chain entrypoint because all stream state is local to the contract instance that created it and cannot be transferred between instances.

---

#### Handling in-flight streams during upgrade

| Stream status | Recommended action |
|---|---|
| `Active` | Notify recipient. Let stream run to completion on V5, or cancel and recreate on V6. |
| `Paused` | Resume on V5, then cancel and recreate on V6 if desired. |
| `Cancelled` | Recipient must withdraw remaining accrued amount from V5 before it is abandoned. |
| `Completed` | No action needed; all funds already withdrawn. |

**Minimum notice period:** Announce the V5 deprecation date at least **14 days** before abandoning the V5 instance. This gives recipients time to withdraw accrued funds.

**TTL risk:** V5 persistent entries expire after ~7 days of inactivity (`PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT = 120_960 ledgers`). If a stream has not been touched for 7 days, its storage entry may expire and become unrecoverable. Operators must ensure recipients are notified before TTL expiry.

---

#### Rollback procedure

If V6 must be rolled back:

1. **Stop routing new traffic** to the V6 `CONTRACT_ID` immediately.
2. **Re-point integrations** to the V5 `CONTRACT_ID`.
3. **Verify V5 is still live**: call `version()` and `get_config()` on V5.
4. **Drain any streams created on V6**: cancel or let them complete, then recreate on V5 if needed.
5. **Announce rollback** to all integrators.

V6 introduces no irreversible on-chain state changes that would prevent rollback to V5. The `DelegatedWithdrawNonce` entries on V6 are local to the V6 instance and have no effect on V5.

---

#### Pre-flight checklist (V6 deployment)

```bash
# 1. Build V6 WASM
cargo build --release -p wallie_de_sensei_stream --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 2. Verify version constant
grep "CONTRACT_VERSION" contracts/stream/src/lib.rs
# Expected: pub const CONTRACT_VERSION: u32 = 6;

# 3. Deploy
source .env
bash script/deploy-testnet.sh

# 4. Verify
stellar contract invoke --id $(cat .contract_id) -- version
# Expected: 6

stellar contract invoke --id $(cat .contract_id) -- get_config
# Expected: {"token": "C...", "admin": "G..."}

# 5. Smoke-test new entrypoints
stellar contract invoke --id $(cat .contract_id) -- get_delegated_nonce \
  --recipient <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
# Expected: 0
```

## Token Pulls & Allowances

Fluxora uses an **allowance-based model** (via `transfer_from`) to pull tokens from your wallet when creating or topping up a stream. This means you must explicitly approve the contract to spend tokens on your behalf.

### 1. Check current allowance

Before creating a stream, you can check if you've already approved the contract:

```bash
# Replace <TOKEN_ID>, <SENDER_ADDRESS>, and <CONTRACT_ID>
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "<TOKEN_ID>" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -- allowance \
    --from "<SENDER_ADDRESS>" \
    --spender "<CONTRACT_ID>"
```

### 2. Grant approval

If the allowance is insufficient, grant approval to the contract. Note that you must specify an **expiration ledger**.

```bash
# Approve contract to spend 1,000,000 tokens (e.g. 1 USDC if 6 decimals)
# Expiration ledger should be sufficiently far in the future (e.g. current + 10,000)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "<TOKEN_ID>" \
  --network testnet \
  --source "$STELLAR_SECRET_KEY" \
  -- approve \
    --from "<SENDER_ADDRESS>" \
    --spender "<CONTRACT_ID>" \
    --amount 1000000 \
    --expiration_ledger 1000000
```

### 3. Create stream

Once approved, you can call `create_stream` normally. The contract will pull the exact `deposit_amount` and the allowance will be consumed accordingly.

> [!TIP]
> Most modern Soroban wallets (like Freighter) handle this two-step process automatically by prepending an `approve` operation to your transaction bundle.

---

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Fund test accounts** for stream recipients via [testnet faucet](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test)
2. **Create streams** with realistic test data (senders, recipients, amounts, durations)
3. **Monitor accrual** by calling `get_stream_state` at different times
4. **Test withdrawals** via the `withdraw` method
5. **Pause/resume/cancel** streams to verify state transitions
