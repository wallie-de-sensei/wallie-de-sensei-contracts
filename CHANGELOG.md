### Added

#### Functions
- `init(token: Address, admin: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Initialize the contract with token address and admin. Must be called exactly once before any other operations.

- `create_stream(sender: Address, recipient: Address, deposit_amount: i128, rate_per_second: i128, start_time: u64, cliff_time: u64, end_time: u64) -> Result<u64, ContractError>`
  Create a new payment stream and transfer deposit from sender. Returns unique stream ID.

- `create_streams(sender: Address, streams: Vec<CreateStreamParams>) -> Result<Vec<u64>, ContractError>`
  Batch-create multiple streams in one atomic transaction. Returns vector of stream IDs.

- `pause_stream(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Halt withdrawals for a stream. Accrual continues based on time.

- `resume_stream(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Re-enable withdrawals for a paused stream.

- `cancel_stream(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Terminate a stream and refund unstreamed tokens to sender. Recipient can still withdraw accrued amount.

- `withdraw(stream_id: u64) -> Result<i128, ContractError>` (recipient only)
  Withdraw accrued tokens to the recipient's address. Returns amount withdrawn.

- `withdraw_to(stream_id: u64, destination: Address) -> Result<i128, ContractError>` (recipient only)
  Withdraw accrued tokens to a specified destination address. Returns amount withdrawn.

- `batch_withdraw(recipient: Address, stream_ids: Vec<u64>) -> Result<Vec<BatchWithdrawResult>, ContractError>` (recipient only)
  Withdraw from multiple streams in one transaction. Returns vector of withdrawal results.

- `top_up_stream(stream_id: u64, funder: Address, added_amount: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>`
  Add tokens to an existing stream's deposit. Any funder can add tokens.

- `update_rate_per_second(stream_id: u64, new_rate_per_second: i128) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Change the streaming rate for an active stream.

- `shorten_stream_end_time(stream_id: u64, new_end_time: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Move stream end time earlier and refund excess deposit to sender.

- `extend_stream_end_time(stream_id: u64, new_end_time: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (sender only)
  Move stream end time later to extend streaming duration.

- `close_completed_stream(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>`
  Remove a completed stream from storage. Anyone can call for cleanup.

- `cancel_stream_as_admin(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Administrative override to cancel any stream, bypassing sender authorization.

- `pause_stream_as_admin(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Administrative override to pause any stream, bypassing sender authorization.

- `resume_stream_as_admin(stream_id: u64) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Administrative override to resume any paused stream, bypassing sender authorization.

- `set_admin(new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Rotate the contract admin address to a new address.

- `set_global_emergency_paused(paused: bool) -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Set or clear the global emergency pause flag. When true, blocks most user operations.

- `global_resume() -> Result<(), ContractError>` (admin only)
  Clear the global emergency pause flag and restore normal operations.

  Enumeration of possible stream states.

- `Stream { stream_id: u64, sender: Address, recipient: Address, deposit_amount: i128, rate_per_second: i128, start_time: u64, cliff_time: u64, end_time: u64, withdrawn_amount: i128, status: StreamStatus, cancelled_at: Option<u64> }`
  Complete stream data structure stored in persistent storage.

- `BatchWithdrawResult { stream_id: u64, amount: i128 }`
  Per-stream result for batch withdrawal operations.

### Changed
- (nothing for initial release)

### Fixed
- (nothing for initial release)

### Security
- All state-mutating functions require appropriate authorization via require_auth()
- Admin functions are restricted to contract admin address set during init
- Sender functions require authorization from stream sender
- Recipient functions require authorization from stream recipient
- CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern used to reduce reentrancy risk
- Global emergency pause allows admin to block most user operations in emergencies
- Token transfers use centralized pull_token/push_token helpers for security review
